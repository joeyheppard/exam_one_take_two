# Teach the Padawans (middle schoolers) the ways of the force.

## Your goal is to create a lesson to teach absolute beginners how to program! There are two sections you may pick from. Your students must walk away with a working program and a class average of a B on your self made assessment.

## Section 1
### Criteria to Cover in your lesson
There are four crucial things you to know when you start coding.
- variables
- arrays
- if/else
- for loops
#arrays
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

print(arr)
#variable
For "a" use(hotdog)

For "b" use(burger)

#else/if
if cookies >= ice cream
  print("there is more cookies")
  else
  print(there are more ice cream boxes)

#for loops
grades = [80,90,70,95,100,60]
def donuts(grades)
#the iterator represents every item in
sum = 0
div = 0
  for student_grade in grades:
#call our functions
donuts(grades_1)
donuts(grades_2)
## Section 2
### Criteria to cover in your lesson
- nesting
  - if/else
  - for loops
- methods

# You don't need to worry about setting up and IDE or installing Python. This will all be handled.
